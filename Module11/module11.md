# Automation and DevOps

## CloudFormation

IaC to create resources using JSON and YAML templates (we've seen this topic in various situations throughout the course)

## Lambda

Executes code without the need to manage servers. It's called, takes actions - within 15 minutes - and "shuts down"

## CodePipeline

Uploads the code, runs tests and deploys.

## System Manager

Helps keep services updated, automates operational tasks and manages instances.

## Step Function
Creates workflows

## SDK 
Already seen in the previous module and even made a [demo](/Module10/module10.md#cloudformation)
